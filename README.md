# meal-adder
Data entry app for the Something To Cook API database.

## Purpose and Use
This tool can be used to connect to the STC database hosted at any remote location. Using a verified API key, the user can add new meals, categories, origins and tags to the database to be immediately available on the API.

## Obtaining an API Key
There is no automated method for obtaining an API key for the STC database as access is very heavily restricted to trusted sources. You must request an API key from the owner of this repository.
